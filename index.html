    <p>
      I’m grateful every day because God brought you into my life.
You are the reason I smile, the reason I rise from all my exhaustion.

Today is a special day, Bebiinduttt
because the one I love most was born into this world.

Thank you for loving me so sincerely.
Thank you for being my home, my storyteller, and the keeper of my heart.

I don’t know how to live without you, and I don’t want to know.
Because every second with you is an irreplaceable blessing.

Happy birthday, Bebi my love.
May all your dreams and wishes come true, and I pray I can always be by your side —
in laughter, in tears, in love, forever.

I love you. Today, tomorrow, and always. 💖
